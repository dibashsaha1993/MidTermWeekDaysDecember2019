Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. Programming language is a set of instructions written in codes consists of integers and string variables that a computer can understand.




What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.





What is IDE?
A. Integrated development enviroment.



What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. there are quite a few IDE that supports java and available in market, mostly used ones are: Eclipse, netbeans, IntelliJ, atom.


Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.


what is class?
A. A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

What is object?
A. A Java object is a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make certain type of data useful.


What is the entry point of an application?
A. An application entry point identifies a resource that is an access point to an application. Application entry points are used to control users' access to different versions of an application that is deployed on a platform.

Why main is static?
A.  Java program's main method has to be declared static because keyword static allows main to be called without creating an object of the class in which the main method is defined.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. Object class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables. Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations. A Java abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior. Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.You cannot create an object of abstract class or interface since they are incomplete class (interface is not even considered as a class.) What you can do is to implement a subclass of abstract class which, of course, must not be abstract.

what is Access Specifier?
A.Access specifiers are keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.object oriented programming, features are : abstraction-is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, Оnly the functionality will be provided to the user.     : Encapsulation- making private methods and initializing getter and setter to use it in a different class. :polymorphism-this is implementing same method with different parameters, consists of method over loading and overriding. : Inheritance-main class can be extended in a sub class in multi levels, the sub class inherites the quality of the mother class.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.The packages available by default in Java include : The java. lang package is imported implicitly, which contains a number of components that are used very commonly in Java programs like for primitive types.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.Application Programming Interface. An Application Programming Interface (API) is a tool set that programmers can use in helping them create software. JSON-RPC.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.java does not support multiple inheritances through classes but through the interfaces, we can use multiple inheritances . It is because it leads to overriding of methods when both extended class have a same method name.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument lists are different. It is similar to constructor overloading in Java, that allows a class to have more than one constructor having different argument lists.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.An exception object is an instance of an exception class. It gets created and handed to the Java runtime when an exceptional event occurred that disrupted the normal flow of the application. This is called “to throw an exception” because in Java you use the keyword “throw” to hand the exception to the runtime. we can also use try catch method to find exceptions.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.static keyword is mainly used for memory management. It can be used with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable or method of a given class. Basically, static is used for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.final keyword is used in different contexts. First of all, final is a non-access modifier applicable only to a variable, a method or a class. Following are different contexts where final is used. When a variable is declared with final keyword, its value can't be modified, essentially, a constant.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A. Final is a keyword. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
A.A constructor resembles an instance method in java but it’s not a method as it doesn’t have a return type

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.yes as long the parameters are not the same.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.All classes have at least one constructor. If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor, called the default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.this is a keyword in Java. It can be used inside the method or constructor of a class.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent ... We could access maxSpeed of base class in sublcass using super keyword.

What is JVM stand for ?
A.Java virtual machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
A.Yes.

What version of java are you using?
A.13.0

What is JAR stand for ?
A.Java Archive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.JVM is Java Virtual Machine, the JVM actually runs Java bytecode.
JDK is Java Developer Kit, the JDK is what you need to compile Java source code.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.The JRE is the environment within which the virtual machine runs. JRE is the container, JVM is the content. Java Runtime Environment contains JVM, class libraries, and other supporting files.

What is compile time and run time?
A.Runtime and compile time are programming terms that refer to different stages of software program development. Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered is converted to executable while Run-time is the instance where the executable is running.

What is heap?
A.A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

How java manage it's memory?
A.The JVM loads the code, verifies the code, executes the code, manages memory (this includes allocating memory from the Operating System (OS), managing Java allocation including heap compaction and removal of garbage objects) and finally provides the runtime environment.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object gets created. The difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuffer is thread-safe. So when the application needs to be run only in a single thread then it is better to use StringBuilder . StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer .

What is Singleton class?
A.A singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object.

when to use transient variable in java?
A.The Java transient keyword is used on class attributes/variables to indicate that serialization process of such class should ignore such variables while creating a persistent byte stream for any instance of that class. A transient variable is a variable that can not be serialized.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.while loop check condition before iteration of the loop. On the other hand, the do-while loop verifies the condition after the execution of the statements inside the loop.

What is Enum?
A.An enum is a user-defined type consisting of a set of named constants called enumerators.

What is Iterator?
A.an iterator is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. Various types of iterators are often provided via a container's interface.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.integer will.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool. Another reason of why String class is immutable could die due to HashMap. Since Strings are very popular as HashMap key, it's important for them to be immutable so that they can retrieve the value object which was stored in HashMap.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object. Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in same class.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.A serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation, while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

What is JIT stands for?
A.Just in time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.In automatic process, programmers need not initiate the garbage collection process explicitly in the code. ... It can choose to reject the request and so it is not guaranteed that these calls will do the garbage collection.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function call while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.Reflection is an API that is used to examine or modify the behaviour of methods. Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods etc. at compile time.

what is multithreading in java?
A.Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.Synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutually exclusive access to a shared resource with multiple threads in Java. Synchronization in Java guarantees that no two threads can execute a synchronized method which requires the same lock simultaneously or concurrently.

What is Framework?
A.an essential supporting structure of an object.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A.JTest. ... The Grinder. ...TestNG. ...JUnit. ...JWalk. ...Mockito. ...

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A.TestNG uses test groups, which can categorize tests according to features such as run times. As I said at the beginning of this column, JUnit 4 and TestNG are similar on the surface. But whereas JUnit is designed to hone in on a unit of code, TestNG is meant for high-level testing.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A.

what is dependency injection in java?
A. dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A.Static binding uses Type information for binding while Dynamic binding uses Objects to resolve binding. Overloaded methods are resolved (deciding which method to be called when there are multiple methods with same name) using static binding while overridden methods using dynamic binding.
